# coin-collector-game
A 2D mobile friendly web platformer game made with Phaser.js and its android(cordova) port.  
  
  This was made following the book Discover Phaser by Thomas Palef, and also have my original features. It contains copyrighted material(mostly music) and is not for commercial purposes. Use it only for educational and testing purposes.  
  
  ## How to start
  For Phaser, you will need a web server like XAMPP, index.js won't load the game without a server. Open index.js in the server and the game will start

  ## Contribution
  Run the apk file in your mobile and create issue if its performance(fps, can be found on top-right of the game screen) is not optimal(55 - 60). Mention your mobile details as well.
